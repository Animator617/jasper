List for ideas that should com in that AI like Funktions or commands

# first idea : understanding human's spech
## the base :
jasper will receive the words a human talk and store them in strings so jasper can process them 
jasper also receive the sound of the spoken word or phrase like voice frequency ( hight or low sound ) and loud and quiet 
this way jasper should learn to full understand the human speech 
## the basic idea example :
I write a basic directory for jasper witch defined what word or phrase a human tell to jasper need what response 
ex."delete file xy"
means delegate the file xy

but if the human use sarcasm while telling this frase 
The human tell it in different pronunciation jasper should detect this and because that isn't saved in the directory 
jasper don't know 100% what to do so he has to ask what the user will 
The user tell him that this means the oposide of the sentence he toled
so jasper adjust the ANN and learns to recognise the sarcasm 

if jasper that do something the user don't want it's why jasper misunderstand the user 
The user need to tell it jasper using a specific sentence style 
this way jasper learned this mistake and make it better nextime

all jasper learn is right as long as jasper will not get corrected the mistake he made.

this will get trained using voice chats in discord as well as on the home pc.

## how to code that 
to code that I'll decide to use 
> c++ for the ANN  
> python for the sound input  
> c for connect python to c++  
#### c++ 
in c++ I will write the ANN that get learned to understand the user speech 
also the reaction functions if jasper are written in c++

#### python 
in python I will write the bot for discord and maybe for WhatsApp  
and I will create the sound detecting

#### c 
in c I will connect python with the c++ core   
becours e the python c/c++ library is mainly written in c so using c to fareoard the values from python to c++ and backwards   
seems for me make the most sense
