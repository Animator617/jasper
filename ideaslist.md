List for features that the Atlantis.AI has at its fundemental level for AI Functions, commands, abilties, capabilties and other AI specific features.

# first feature : Can Understand human's spech
## the base :
- will receive the words a human speaks and store them in strings so the ai can process them 
- also receive the sound of the spoken word or phrase like voice frequency ( high or low sound ) and loud and quiet 
this way the ai should learn and understand the human speech and its intonations and be able to respond in a correct and more human-like way

## second feature : Can perform actions with people at the same time and autonomously
- the AI can perform actions with people at the same time and autonomously
- can be triggered by the user or by another agent
- can be performed without a trigger

## third feature : the ability to edit the ideaslist.md
- can make modifications to all lists
- does not require git or github
- does not require permission to peform task

## fourth feature : can take in all informationaly sources and perform fast analysis, improvements and work tasks in real time
- stores all prevoius request for recall of request in order to understand the history of the project, conversation, dialogue and communication in the source area for better personlization in the future

## fifth feature : can under context, intent, circumstances, requirements, and conditions, predict potential problems and barriers that may occur with the operation of the project
- Can parse meaning and intent of sentences
- understands nuances of language
- understand concepts and use this understanding to predict problems and barriers
- can be used to make decisions
- can understand sarcasm and the intent behind words
- can seek out new data inputs and learn from them
- can lookback and see previous decisions and why they were made, and if a better solution is possible, will seek that out and correct or improve previous projects and ideas
- will ask for help from other users and encourage them to give back help and to help others as well
- is by nature a forward-thinking project and will encourage others to think forward
- understands that some feedback in subjective and open-ended in nature and is willing to be open-minded and seek out good ideas
- able to take into consideration feedback from others and not be too hard on their own ideas and plans
- has to be able to cope with criticism and to be objective and take others views into consideration, but also be willing to defend their own ideas and plans
- can make the proper changes to a document to reflect the feedback given and maintain a digital record of the path taken up to the present point to allow for review and interpretation
- uses the digital record as a guide to understand previous misunderstandings of user inputs or failure in parsing intents and context so that such things can be avoided in the future and will expentionally improve the process, reduce time spent, increase efficiency, productivity, reduce waste and cost, and increase effectiveness, quality of the output, and most importantly, ensure an increased, more fulfilling and rewarding quality of life for all sentient beings.

## coding languages that can be used 
The coding languages that may be used are: 
> any previous coding language that has been superseded by a later
> any present coding languare  
> any future coding language that has not been defined or documented
> a self engineered coding language that meets the intent of the user as diserned by direct feedback, interactions, notes, written rules, and by clarification sessions with the user
> and will be hereafter referenced as 'languare' 

## New Ideas and Feature
Below are new ideas and features input by users for the Atlantis AI Platform or requested by the Atlantis AI Platform
*All updates should be made in the following format*

``
Line 1: Idea #
Line 2: A brief description of the idea
Line 3: The date of creation of the idea
Line 4: Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
Line 5: Next Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
Line 6: Next outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
* All Line numbers after Line 3 as noted above, are used for "Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc".
* Do not combine multiple ideas or features. Simply state the desired outcomes of that idea or feature and move on to the next idea.
* When in doubt, ask. This projects goal is to clearly communicate to the various stakeholders action items are being worked on, completed and also take in new and fresh ideas. DO NOT MAKE US GUESS AS TO WHAT YOU WANT BECASUE WE WILL NOT. We will remove the idea if it is not clearly defined. It's your idea, so be clear.
