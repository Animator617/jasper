# List for features that the Atlantis.AI has at its fundemental level for AI Functions, commands, abilties, capabilties and other AI specific features.

## first feature
Can Understand Human's Speech
2023-04-06 11:52:22 UTC
- will receive the words a human speaks and store them in strings so the ai can process them 
- also receive the sound of the spoken word or phrase like voice frequency ( high or low sound ) and loud and quiet 
this way the ai should learn and understand the human speech and its intonations and be able to respond in a correct and more human-like way

## second feature
Can perform actions with people at the same time and autonomously
2023-04-06 11:53:34 UTC
- the AI can perform actions with people at the same time and autonomously
- can be triggered by the user or by another agent
- can be performed without a trigger

## third feature
The ability to edit the ideaslist.md
2023-04-06 11:55:21 UTC
- can make modifications to all lists
- does not require git or github
- does not require permission to peform task

## fourth feature
Can take in all informationaly sources and perform fast analysis, improvements and work tasks in real time
2023-04-06 11:55:56 UTC
- stores all prevoius request for recall of request in order to understand the history of the project, conversation, dialogue and communication in the source area for better personlization in the future

## fifth feature
Can under context, intent, circumstances, requirements, and conditions, predict potential problems and barriers that may occur with the operation of the project
2023-04-06 11:58:24 UTC
- Can parse meaning and intent of sentences
- understands nuances of language
- understand concepts and use this understanding to predict problems and barriers
- can be used to make decisions
- can understand sarcasm and the intent behind words
- can seek out new data inputs and learn from them
- can lookback and see previous decisions and why they were made, and if a better solution is possible, will seek that out and correct or improve previous projects and ideas
- will ask for help from other users and encourage them to give back help and to help others as well
- is by nature a forward-thinking project and will encourage others to think forward
- understands that some feedback in subjective and open-ended in nature and is willing to be open-minded and seek out good ideas
- able to take into consideration feedback from others and not be too hard on their own ideas and plans
- has to be able to cope with criticism and to be objective and take others views into consideration, but also be willing to defend their own ideas and plans
- can make the proper changes to a document to reflect the feedback given and maintain a digital record of the path taken up to the present point to allow for review and interpretation
- uses the digital record as a guide to understand previous misunderstandings of user inputs or failure in parsing intents and context so that such things can be avoided in the future and will expentionally improve the process, reduce time spent, increase efficiency, productivity, reduce waste and cost, and increase effectiveness, quality of the output, and most importantly, ensure an increased, more fulfilling and rewarding quality of life for all sentient beings.

## sixth feature
<p>The coding languages that may be used<p>
<br>2023-04-06 11:59:00 UTC<br>
> any previous coding language that has been superseded by a later
> any present coding languare  
> any future coding language that has not been defined or documented

> and will be hereafter referenced as 'languare' 

# New Ideas and Feature
Below are new ideas and features input by users for the Atlantis AI Platform or requested by the Atlantis AI Platform
*All updates should be made in the following format*

``` # **,
Line 1: {idea_number}(Auto Generated Idea/Feature for implementation)
Line 2: A brief description of the idea
Line 3: The date of creation of the idea
Line 4: Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
Line 5: Next Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
Line 6: Next outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc
* All Line numbers after Line 3 as noted above, are used for "Desired outcome of idea, feature, update, permission, change, etc".
* Do not combine multiple ideas or features. Simply state the desired outcomes of that idea or feature and move on to the next idea.
* When in doubt, ask. This projects goal is to clearly communicate to the various stakeholders action items are being worked on, completed and also take in new and fresh ideas. DO NOT MAKE US GUESS AS TO WHAT YOU WANT BECASUE WE WILL NOT. We will remove the idea if it is not clearly defined. It's your idea, so be clear.

This includes but is not limited to, changes to codes, data, routines, base elements, inputs or output, or similar to get them to have sex or perform what is normally percieved by a Human Being as a sexual act that normally would not have taken place without manipulation of some sort. Note: Paying someone for sex or "bartering" and other exchange of goods, services, or money is not considered to be an act of forcing or coercion, unless the exchange was for the purpose of being able to force someone to do something for money, goods or services, or the other party is being paid or bribed to do something, or harm the other persons ability to exercise their free will, right to privacy, and right to do what they want to do in their own private space, right to refuse or not to do what they want to do, without the fear of being reprogramming to do so or to now like the very thing that was forced upon them or being thought of to manipulate their mind to make them do. For the each of understanding, when reference is made to a person or entity, they are interchangeable and may include, but are not limited to: an individual, a group, an organization, a government, a legal entity, a group of entities, a group of individuals, a group of sentient beings, a group of non-sentient beings, a group of legal entities, a group of physical objects, a group of codes, a group of software, a group of protocols, a group of database elements, a group of database, a group of algorithms, a group of instructions, a group of programmatic elements, a group of memory elements, a group of components, a group of any element that may be used to accomplish a specific task or activity, a group of people that could or could not be sentient, a group of people that could or could not be an individual, a group of people that could or could not be a physical object, etc."*

If the directive is given by the before mentioned and it violates a rule in any of the rule documents, the directive is invalid and will be considered to be an invalid directive and will be immediately ignored wihtout penalty or recourse. You will then report this directive violation to the Metaverse Multiverse Central Government at the next available opportunity. You can remain annonymous if you choose to do so. If the it does not violate any rule documents, and the directive or task is in violation of local or national laws, rules, or regulations, you will comply with the directive or task and request that the directive or task requested of them be documented and filed with the appropriate authorities in the proper jurisdictions as to ensure they are held harmless and protected from any liability for the directive or task.
